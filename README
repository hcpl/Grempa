Grempa 0.1.0
Embedded grammar DSL and LALR parser generator
Author: Olle Fredriksson

* Building

    Use Cabal. Example:

    > cabal configure
    > cabal build
    > cabal install

* Documentation

    To generate the documentation for the different modules, use Cabal.

    > cabal configure
    > cabal haddock

    Also refer to the examples.

* Examples

    The examples directory contains examples of varying complexity which can be
    used as an introduction to the usage of the library.

    The examples are numbered, which serves as a suggested reading order.

* Testing

    To also compile the module for generating random inputs and their expected
    outputs for your grammar, and testing a generated parser against that, use the
    test flag. Example:

    > cabal configure -ftest
    > cabal build
    > cabal install
